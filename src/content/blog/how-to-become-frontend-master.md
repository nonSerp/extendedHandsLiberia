Humanity is an act of selflessness and compassion we should mirror ourselves into and live it out.
This is Patience 31yrs old, mother of 3 children which includes little Vera who sells plastic in redlight market.
Patience has been sick and  diagnosed of Chronic Cold and Asthma for close to a year since her house got burnt on January 18, 2024 in Mount Barclay community.
Currently, the only means of survival for patience and her children is her 14yrs old daughter Vera who stands as breadwinner for the family by selling plastic in the streets throughout the week.

Patience will appreciate a little kindness from anybody to help her get treatment and business support to get her children back in school.
It's our hope that Patience's story touches the heart of someone to extend a hand and make them smile.
