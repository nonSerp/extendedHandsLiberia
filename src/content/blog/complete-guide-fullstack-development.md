Last April, our team came across Ma Martha, in Bassa Town, Fendell community, who called out the central government for assistance in roofing her house because, during the rainy season, it can be bad. Upon hearing her cry our team Extended Hands Liberia  decided to put a smile on her face by renovating the roof over her house. Ma Martha expressed gratitude to Extended Hands Liberia 🇱🇷 for coming through to help her.
